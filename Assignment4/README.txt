This is --'s Assignment4 submission.

The code folder contains only the code files. All the test files are in the Tests>input folder.

The input folder contains the original Rats.txt
However, the original Rats.txt file had some coding issues and symbols like apostrophe (’) and hyphen (—) would give garbage as input.
Rats2.txt is almost identical, I only changed ’ to ' and — to - and it works perfectly.
I've also created my own Test.txt file that contains easier to test text for validity purposes.

The output folder contains the output files: Summary.txt is for Rats2.txt,
Summary2.txt is for Test.txt 
and Summary3.txt is for Test.txt as well but with purpose to test the naming system.
There are also screenshots for said tests.
