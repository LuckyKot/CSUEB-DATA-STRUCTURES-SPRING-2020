This is --'s Assignment3 submission.

The code folder contains all the source code + provided quotes.txt that is necessary for
the assignment to work.

The Tests folder contains multiple folders of different tests. Each folder has a name 
corresponding to the test. (Did this because otherwise the OS would throw errors for identical names
of nskipmgram_quotes.txt) Every test folder has nskipmgram_quotes.txt and a screenshot of said test.
